### I'm a Python developer, soccer performance analyst. I am currently learning Machine Learning.

### Despite the fact that in my life I have gone through different areas of knowledge, such as a law degree, strategic planning, digital content creation, I have found my true passion in **data science**.

### I have been martial arts for 31 years, and that has left me with a great sense of discipline, responsibility, honor and loyalty.
